# [Project 1: Skin Cancer Pattern Extraction and Prediction Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)](https://github.com/Teamkronos/skin_cancer_classifier)
* The dataset chosen for this comparative analysis is titled Human Against Machine with 10,000 training images (HAM10000)
* It contains 10,015 (450 x 600 x 3) coloured high-resolution images of skin lesions labelled into three classes.
* Trained five CNNs: ResNet, InceptionV3, Xception, VGG-16 and DenseNet with hyper-parameters via the HAM10000 dataset and detailed the performance of these models. 
* Also tested the final model ResNet50 with custom weights on two external datasets being ISIC-2019 and PAD-UFES-20. 
* The benefits of this study include a novel approach to melanoma detection using CNNs, as well as an important aid for melanoma diagnosis in clinical settings.

# [Project 2: To find out which company is leading the mobile device market through an interactive visualization and self-organising mapping(SOM)](https://github.com/Teamkronos/mobile_device_market_leader)
* The dataset contains 213 companies that produced different mobile devices from 1989 to 2012. 
* There are 16 dimensions with 3162 rows
* The goal of this project is to extract meaningful information from a dataset through a interactive visualization method and SOM. 
* Used Python libraries - Plotly and Dash to extract valuable information for this project. 
* Used SOM and dashboard as tools in creating different visualisations to investigate which devices or companies are the most successful in leading the market.
