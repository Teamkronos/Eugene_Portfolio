# [Project 1: Skin Cancer Pattern Extraction and Prediction Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)] (FULL LINK)
* The dataset chosen for this comparative analysis is titled Human Against Machine with 10,000 training images (HAM10000)
* It contains 10,015 (450 x 600 x 3) coloured high-resolution images of skin lesions labelled into seven classes.
* Trained five CNNs: ResNet, InceptionV3, Xception, VGG-16 and DenseNet with hyper-parameters via the HAM10000 dataset and detailed the performance of these models. 
* Also tested the final model ResNet50 with custom weights on two external datasets being ISIC-2019 and PAD-UFES-20. 
* The benefits of this study include a novel approach to melanoma detection using CNNs, as well as an important aid for melanoma diagnosis in clinical settings.
