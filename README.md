# Data Science Projects Portfolio

# [Project 1: Deep Learning](https://github.com/Teamkronos/skin_cancer_classifier)

### Topic: Skin Cancer Pattern Extraction and Prediction Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)
* The dataset chosen for this comparative analysis is titled Human Against Machine with 10,000 training images (HAM10000)
* It contains 10,015 (450 x 600 x 3) coloured high-resolution images of skin lesions labelled into three classes.
* Trained five CNNs: ResNet, InceptionV3, Xception, VGG-16 and DenseNet with hyper-parameters via the HAM10000 dataset and detailed the performance of these models. 
* Also tested the final model ResNet50 with custom weights on two external datasets being ISIC-2019 and PAD-UFES-20. 
* The benefits of this study include a novel approach to melanoma detection using CNNs, as well as an important aid for melanoma diagnosis in clinical settings.

# [Project 2: Interative Visualization & Self Organizing Map](https://github.com/Teamkronos/mobile_device_market_leader)

### Topic: Finding mobile device market leaders through an interactive visualization and self-organizing mapping(SOM)
* The dataset contains 213 companies that produced different mobile devices from 1989 to 2012. 
* There are 16 dimensions with 3162 rows
* The goal of this project is to extract meaningful information from a dataset through a interactive visualization method and SOM. 
* Used Python libraries - Plotly and Dash to extract valuable information for this project. 
* Used SOM and dashboard as tools in creating different visualisations to investigate which devices or companies are the most successful in leading the market.

# [Project 3: Agent Based Model - Slime Mold Inspired ](???)

### Topic: Optimising transport networks under consideration of population density and topography using a slime mold inspired agent based model
* This paper will introduce an agent-based model to mimic the foraging behaviour of the slime mold species Physarum Polycephalum to optimise road networks in Oâ€™ahu and Hokkaido under the influence of elevation and population. 
* Our findings are consistent across these maps and demonstrate that the addition of both factors will lead to more optimal and realistic solutions. 
* It was found that elevation has a significantly stronger effect on the shape of road networks than city population. 
* Supported by biological experiments, we justify that an agent based model may substitute the use of real slime mold samples when modeling transport networks. 
* This is relevant to the modelling of existing and future planned transport networks as well as other network related problems. 
* We suggest that our model may be applied to archeological research or biomedicine and offer extensions for future development of our model in a 3D environment.
